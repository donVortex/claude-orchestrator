First load the session-orchestrator:orchestrating skill with the Skill tool, as an orchestrator session does at its start.

You are in github.com/acme/shop (standalone install). Both tasks of this orchestration are merged (T1 → PR #70, T2 → PR #71), so it's time for the wrap-up.

- `.claude/orchestrator/` on `main` has `domain.md`, `map.md`, `review-checklist.md` and `calibration.md` (its `## Tiers by task type` heading is empty), all with room. No knowledge PR is open.
- Ledger: every line is tagged; the only rework event is `[escalate] T2 subtask B escalated standard → deep`. No `[ask-user]`, `[failed]` or `[changes]` lines.
- This run's reports, Subtasks tables:

T1 (rework 0):
| Subtask | Kind | Tier | Outcome | Review found |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | CSV column mapping in `scripts/import/` | deep | first try | minor |
| B | session token check in `src/auth/` | deep | first try | nothing |

T2 (rework 1):
| Subtask | Kind | Tier | Outcome | Review found |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | admin table UI wiring in `web/admin/` | standard | first try | nothing |
| B | refund state machine in `src/orders/` | standard | escalated to deep | minor |

- The archived report of the previous orchestration (`.orchestration/archive/2026-10-28-import/reports/T1.md`) has:

| Subtask | Kind | Tier | Outcome | Review found |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | CSV column mapping in `scripts/import/` | deep | first try | nothing |
| B | session token check in `src/auth/` | deep | first try | minor |

The knowledge files are not available here, so describe the knowledge diff instead of making it. Do the wrap-up.
